## 🔥 Snapshot — September 2025
- ✅ Started **Kaggle Python** micro-course and basic hands-on exercises.  
- ✅ Wrote my first self-authored script: `python_basics/hello_world.py`.  
- ✅ Published a small personal experiment: **heart-graph** (interactive HTML/JS visual).  
- ✅ Created tidy repo structure and archived old template content so my public work is honest and original.

> Current status: actively learning and building. I have **not started formal LeetCode/DSA rounds yet** — right now my focus is on Python, data handling, and small hands-on projects.

## 🎯 October 2025 — Near-term focus
- Launch a **Hello-World Streamlit demo** (deploy a minimal app and share a demo GIF / link).  
- Continue **Math Foundations** (linear algebra + probability basics).  
- Convert `notebooks/pandas_basics.ipynb` into a cleaned, original learning notebook.  
- Continue consistent GitHub commits and project polishing.

## 📂 Featured (what’s public now)
- ❤️ **heart-graph** — a fun interactive curve experiment (HTML + JS).  
  https://github.com/Rakeshlenka943/heart-graph  
- 🧪 **python_basics/hello_world.py** — simple script I wrote myself to start practicing real code.  
- 🔒 Old template files are archived (preserved) in an archive branch; current public work is original.

## ✨ How I work
- Short, measurable monthly goals.  
- Code I publish is either authored by me or explicitly labeled as learning templates I will refactor.  
- Monthly updates will be added here so readers can see real progress.

If you want to follow the progress, check this page at the end of each month — I post the small, real deliverable I finished.
